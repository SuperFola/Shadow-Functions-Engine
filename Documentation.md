# Introduction
## Who the hell am I and what the hecky heck is this?
I am a highschool student, who is interested in computer science and more specifically, creating video games. This project was a challange I gave myself. The aim was to find out if I am able to create something rather complex with my basic understanding of programming, whilst not looking up solutions to my problems. I have already tried my hands at [a project similar to this](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Snake), but this was way more abitious so it was also a test in planning and creating coexsiting systems.
## So what is the project?
The bare minimum I wanted to accomplish was a real time 2D top down game, with a "realistic" binary shading system (this was all planned to be running in the windows console). The concept of the shading system is the following: There is a player (represented by the '@' character); who has a field of view in which he can see things; anything that would block his view (e.g.: an 'x' character) casts a shadow, meaning that he can't see the things behind the "wall", even if those things would be in his field of view.
