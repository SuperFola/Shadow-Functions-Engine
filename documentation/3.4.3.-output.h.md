### 3.4.3. [output.h](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/headers/output/output.h)
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
This header file containts two functions that make rendering smoother and the game run faster and other functions that initialize the information from the different editors. I don't know why I named it output, but its too late now!
#### 3.4.3.1. saveLastScreenArray
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
```cpp
void saveLastScreenArray(char oldS[SCREENROWS][SCREENCOLS], char newS[SCREENROWS][SCREENCOLS])
{
	for (int i = 0; i < SCREENROWS; i++)
	{
		for (int j = 0; j < SCREENCOLS; j++)
		{
			oldS[i][j] = newS[i][j];
		}
	}
}
```
**Usage:** This function saves the textures from the last frame of the "screen" part of the console window.

**Variables:**
* **oldS:** This array will hold the textures from the last frame of the "screen" part of the console window.
* **newS:** This array currently holds the textures from the last frame of the "screen" part of the console window.

**How it's done & notes:** The function loops over every variable of the arrays and saves the information from the newS array into the oldS array. With this information the engine will run much smoother and faster.
#### 3.4.3.2. saveLastMenuArray
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
```cpp
void saveLastMenuArray(char oldM[SCREENROWS][MENUCOLS], char newM[SCREENROWS][MENUCOLS])
{
	for (int i = 0; i < SCREENROWS; i++)
	{
		for (int j = 0; j < MENUCOLS; j++)
		{
			oldM[i][j] = newM[i][j];
		}
	}
}
```
**Usage:** This function saves the textures from the last frame of the "menu" part of the console window.

**Variables:**
* **oldM:** This array will hold the textures from the last frame of the "menu" part of the console window.
* **newM:** This array currently holds the textures from the last frame of the "menu" part of the console window.

**How it's done & notes:** The function loops over every variable of the arrays and saves the information from the newM array into the oldM array. With this information the engine will run much smoother and faster. 
#### 3.4.3.3. initSolid
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
```cpp
void initSolid(char solide[SOLIDCOUNT], string fileName)
{
	fstream fbe (fileName.c_str());
	
	for (int i = 0; i < SOLIDCOUNT; i++)
	{
		fbe>>solide[i];
	}
	
	fbe.close();
}
```
**Usage:** This function gets all of the characters loaded from [the solid.txt](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/materials/solid.txt), these characters block light and thus create shadow.

**Variables:**
* **solide:** This array will hold all of the characters that block light.
* **fileName:** This string holds the path from [the main .cpp file](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/ShadowFunctionsEngine.cpp) to [the solid.txt file](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/materials/solid.txt).

**How it's done & notes:** The function opens and reads [the solid.txt file](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/materials/solid.txt). [SOLIDCOUNT](#314-solidcount-and-walkablecount) determines how many of the characters from the file the function loops through. For more information about the solid material editor click [here](#222-how-to-use-the-material-editors).
#### 3.4.3.4. initWalkable
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
```cpp
void initWalkable(char walkablee[WALKABLECOUNT], string fileName)
{
	fstream fbe (fileName.c_str());
	
	for (int i = 0; i < WALKABLECOUNT; i++)
	{
		fbe>>walkablee[i];
	}
	
	fbe.close();
}
```
**Usage:** This function gets all of the characters loaded from [the walkable.txt](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/materials/walkable.txt), these characters don't block player movement.

**Variables:**
* **solide:** This array will hold all of the characters that don't block player movement.
* **fileName:** This string holds the path from [the main .cpp file](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/ShadowFunctionsEngine.cpp) to [the walkable.txt file](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/materials/walkable.txt).

**How it's done & notes:** The function opens and reads [the walkable.txt file](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/materials/walkable.txt). [WALKABLECOUNT](#314-solidcount-and-walkablecount) determines how many of the characters from the file the function loops through. For more information about the walkable material editor click [here](#222-how-to-use-the-material-editors).
#### 3.4.3.5. initWorld
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
```cpp
void initWorld(map world[WORLDROWS][WORLDCOLS], char solide[SOLIDCOUNT], char walkablee[WALKABLECOUNT], string fileName)
{
	char cahr;
	
	freopen(fileName.c_str(),"r",stdin);
	
	for (int i = 0; i < WORLDROWS; i++)
	{
		for (int j = 0; j < WORLDCOLS; j++)
		{
			cin>>cahr;
			
			if (cahr == 'i')
			{
				world[i][j].texture = ' ';
			}
			else
			{
				world[i][j].texture = cahr;
			}
			
			world[i][j].solid = false;
			
			for (int k = 0; k < SOLIDCOUNT; k++)
			{
				if (cahr == solide[k])
				{
					world[i][j].solid = true;
				}
			}
			
			world[i][j].walkable = false;
			
			for (int k = 0; k < WALKABLECOUNT; k++)
			{
				if (cahr == walkablee[k])
				{
					world[i][j].walkable = true;
				}
			}
		}
	}
	
	fclose(stdin);
}
```
**Usage:** This function initializes the map of the world, with all of the important information such as textures, cells blocking light, or player movement etc. attached to each cell.

**Variables:**
* **world:** This array will hold all of the important information about each cell of the map of the game.
* **soldie:** This array holds all of the characters that block light, and thus create shadows.
* **walkablee:** This array holds all of the characters that don't block player movement.
* **fileName:** This string holds the path from [the main .cpp file](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/ShadowFunctionsEngine.cpp) to [the world.txt file](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/maps/world.txt).

**How it's done & notes:** Firstly the function opens [the world.txt file](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/maps/world.txt). Then it starts looping through each character. If the character is an 'i' the function replaces it with a ' ' character for the texture (click [here](#2231-how-to-use-the-map-editor) if you want to find out why this is). Then the function loops through both the solid and walkable characters, and sets the correct attributes of [the structure](#322-map) to the correct values. For more information about the map editor click [here](#223-the-map-editor).
#### 3.4.3.6. initFOV
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
```cpp
void initFOV(fov dir[FOVROWS][FOVCOLS], string fileName)
{
	char cahr;
	
	freopen(fileName.c_str(),"r",stdin);
	
	for (int i = 0; i < FOVROWS; i++)
	{
		for (int j = 0; j < FOVCOLS; j++)
		{
			cin>>cahr;
			
			if (cahr == '_')
			{
				dir[i][j].inView = true;
			}
			else
			{
				dir[i][j].inView = false;
			}
			
			if (cahr == '@')
			{
				dir[i][j].isPlayer = true;
				dir[i][j].inView = true;
			}
			else
			{
				dir[i][j].isPlayer = false;
			}
		}
	}
	
	fclose(stdin);
}
```
**Usage:** This function is used to initialize all of the [FOV arrays](#3317-fov-arrays).

**Variables:**
* **dir:** This array will hold all of the information about the FOV we are initializing right now. 
* **fileName:** This string holds the path from [the main .cpp file](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/ShadowFunctionsEngine.cpp) to the desired FOV file.

**How it's done & notes:** First we open the desired FOV file. Then we start looping through all of the characters. According to the '_' and '@' characters we set the correct sub variable of the structure to true or false. For the meaning of the different characters in the FOV files click [here](#2211-how-to-use-the-fov-editors). For more information about the FOV editors click [here](#221-the-fov-editors).
