### 3.4.4. [render.h](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Shadow-Functions-Engine/blob/master/headers/rendering/render.h)
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
This header contains functions that either help rendering, or actually render stuff.
#### 3.4.4.1. goTo
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
```cpp
void goTo (int row, int column)
{
	HANDLE hStdout;
	hStdout = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);
	
	COORD destCoord;
	
	destCoord.X = column;
	destCoord.Y = row;
	
	SetConsoleCursorPosition(hStdout, destCoord);
}
```
**Usage:** This function puts the cursor into a set position in the console window.

**Variables:**
* **row:** The row of the cell to which the cursor will be put on the console window.
* **col:** The column of the cell to which the cursor will be put on the console window.

**How it's done & notes:** This was one of the three times where I resorted to outside sources to solve my problem. I found my answer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10401724/move-text-cursor-to-particular-screen-coordinate) in the fourth answer.

#### 3.4.4.2. clearScreen
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
```cpp
void clearScreen()
{
	HANDLE hConsole;
	hConsole = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);	

	COORD coordScreen = { 0, 0 };
	DWORD cCharsWritten;
	CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO csbi; 
	DWORD dwConSize;
	
	// Get the number of character cells in the current buffer. 

	if( !GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo( hConsole, &csbi ))
		return;
	dwConSize = csbi.dwSize.X * csbi.dwSize.Y;

	// Fill the entire screen with blanks.

	if( !FillConsoleOutputCharacter( hConsole, (TCHAR) ' ',
    	dwConSize, coordScreen, &cCharsWritten ))
    	return;

	// Get the current text attribute.

	if( !GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo( hConsole, &csbi ))
    	return;

	// Set the buffer's attributes accordingly.

	if( !FillConsoleOutputAttribute( hConsole, csbi.wAttributes,
    	dwConSize, coordScreen, &cCharsWritten ))
    	return;

	// Put the cursor at its home coordinates.

	SetConsoleCursorPosition( hConsole, coordScreen );
}
```
**Usage:** Clears the console window. 

**Variables:** -

**How it's done & notes:** This was one of the three times where I resorted to outside sources to solve my problem. Sadly I didn't keep the original link, but I found this implementation of a clear screen function right [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/clearing-the-screen)!
#### 3.4.4.3. renderScreen
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
```cpp
void renderScreen(char oldS[SCREENROWS][SCREENCOLS], char newS[SCREENROWS][SCREENCOLS])
{
	for (int i = 0; i < SCREENROWS; i++)
	{
		for (int j = 0; j < SCREENCOLS; j++)
		{
			if (newS[i][j] != oldS[i][j])
			{
				goTo(i, j);
				cout<<newS[i][j];
			}
		}
	}
	
	goTo(SCREENROWS, 0);
}
```
**Usage:** This renders the "screen" part of the console window. 

**Variables:**
* **oldS:** This array holds the textures from the last frame of the "screen" part of the console window.
* **newS:** This array holds the textures from this frame of the "screen" part of the console window.

**How it's done & notes:** The function loops through both of the arrays and compares each cell's textures. If there is a difference, it goes to the correct cell of the console window with [the goTo function](#3441-goto), and updates the cell with the correct texture. This means that the engine only updates cells that's texture changed in this frame, if the engine would update every cell every frame that would lead to flashing, sometimes not even completing the updates properly and (obviously) a much slower runtime.
#### 3.4.4.4. renderMenu
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
```cpp
void renderMenu(char oldM[SCREENROWS][MENUCOLS], char newM[SCREENROWS][MENUCOLS])
{
	for (int i = 0; i < SCREENROWS; i++)
	{
		for (int j = 0; j < MENUCOLS; j++)
		{
			if (newM[i][j] != oldM[i][j])
			{
				goTo(i, SCREENCOLS + j);
				cout<<newM[i][j];
			}
		}
	}
}
```
**Usage:** This renders the "menu" part of the console window.

**Variables:**
* **oldM:** This array holds the textures from the last frame of the "menu" part of the console window.
* **newM:** This array holds the textures from this frame of the "menu" part of the console window.

**How it's done & notes:** The function loops through both of the arrays and compares each cell's textures. If there is a difference, it goes to the correct cell of the console window with [the goTo function](#3441-goto), and updates the cell with the correct texture. This means that the engine only updates cells that's texture changed in this frame, if the engine would update every cell every frame that would lead to flashing, sometimes not even completing the updates properly and (obviously) a much slower runtime.
#### 3.4.4.5. calculateScreen
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
```cpp
void calculateScreen(map world[WORLDROWS][WORLDCOLS], char screen[SCREENROWS][SCREENCOLS], int cameraRow, int cameraCol)
{
	for (int i = 0; i < SCREENROWS; i++)
	{
		for (int j = 0; j < SCREENCOLS; j++)
		{
			if (world[i + cameraRow][j + cameraCol].mapInView)
			{
				screen[i][j] = world[i + cameraRow][j + cameraCol].texture;
			}
			else
			{
				if (world[i + cameraRow][j + cameraCol].mapIsEdge)
				{
						screen[i][j] = char(176);
				}
				else
				{
					screen[i][j] = char(178);
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```
**Usage:** This function translates all of the information calculated by the [shadowFunction](#34512-shadowfunction) and [mapIsEdgeCalculation](#34514-mapisedgecalculation) functions into textures that can be rendered.

**Variables:**
* **world:** This array holds all of the information about the cells of the world, like what is or isn't visible, etc.
* **screen:** This array will hold the textures of the "screen" part of the console window after the function is finished.
* **cameraRow:** This is the value that holds in which row the camera is currently.
* **cameraCol:** This is the value that holds in which column the camera is currently.

**How it's done & notes:** The function loops through a part of the map that is equal in size to the "screen" part of the console window. Then if the cell of the world is not in view the texture of the cell on the screen becomes '▓'. If the cell of the world is in the edge, the texture of the cell on the screen becomes'░', and if neither of those are true the texture of the cell on the screen becomes the texture of the cell on the world.
