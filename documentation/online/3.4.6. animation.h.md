###### This section was last checked in the 2.0.0. version of the engine

```cpp
animation initNewAnimation(animation anim, string fileName)
{
	char cahr;
	
	fstream fbe (fileName.c_str());
	
	fbe>>anim.frames>>anim.height>>anim.width;
	
	anim.currentFrame = 0;
	
	for (int g = 0; g < anim.frames; g++)
	{
		for (int i = 0; i < anim.height; i++)
		{
			for (int j = 0; j < anim.width; j++)
			{
				fbe>>cahr;
				
				if (cahr == 'i')
				{
					anim.frameArray[g][i][j] = ' ';
				}
				else
				{
					anim.frameArray[g][i][j] = cahr;
				}
			}
		}
	}

	fbe.close();

	return anim;
}
```

**Usage:** This function initializes a new animation from an appropriate .txt file

**Variables:**

* **anim:** This variable will hold all the relevant information about the animation.
* **fileName:** This string holds the path from the main .cpp file to the .txt that contains the information about the animation.

**How it's done & notes:** First the function opens the correct file, and then reads the frames, height and the width of the animation (these numbers are at the start of the .txt file). Then for each frame it loops through a height by width chunk of characters, replaces all 'i' characters with ' ' characters and reads them into the animation variable. At the end it returns this variable. To learn more about the animation pipeline click here, to learn more about why all the 'i' characters get replaced by ' ' characters click here.
