# 1. Introduction
**Note:** I was using Dev C++ as the IDE with TMD-GCC 4.9.2. as the compiler, I have seen the project not functioning as intended with other IDEs and compilers.
## 1.1. The structure of this documentation
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
This documentation will have three main parts and a table of contents:
* [The first](#1-introduction) is the introduction (the part you are reading right now)
* [The second](#2-how-to-use-the-engine) is an overview of [how the engine works](#21-how-the-engine-works-a-breakdown-of-the-main-cpp-file) and [how you can operate it and it's different editors](#22-how-to-use-the-editors-and-other-further-details)
* The third will go over every last detail about the structures, variables and functions the engine uses

In the [introduction](#1-introduction) I will cover [my motivation](#12-who-the-hell-am-i-and-what-the-hecky-heck-is-this) for this engine, [the idea, the end product and plans about the future of the project](#13-so-what-is-the-project).

[The second part](#2-how-to-use-the-engine) will have two segments. [The first](#21-how-the-engine-works-a-breakdown-of-the-main-cpp-file) detailing the architecture of the system, what it does. [The second](#22-how-to-use-the-editors-and-other-further-details) will be the guide to operate it. Hopefully theese two segments will provide you with sufficent information to make a game with this engine.

The last part will (as mentioned above) go over the hows of the systems in place. It will be broken down into different subsections, each dealing with a header or cpp file and it's structres, variables, or functions.

## 1.2. Who the hell am I and what the hecky heck is this?
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
I am a highschool student, who is interested in computer science and more specifically, creating video games. This project was a challange I gave myself. The aim was to find out if I am able to create something rather complex with my basic understanding of programming, whilst not looking up solutions to my problems. I have already tried my hands at [a project similar to this](https://github.com/mmmuscus/Snake), but this was way more abitious so it was also a test in planning and creating coexsiting systems.

## 1.3. So what is the project?
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
The bare minimum I wanted to accomplish was a real time 2D top down game, with a "realistic" binary shading system (this was all planned to be running in the windows console). The concept of the shading system is the following: There is a player (represented by the '@' character); who has a field of view in which he can see things; anything that would block his view (e.g.: an 'x' character) casts a shadow, meaning that he can't see the things behind the "wall", even if those things would be in his field of view.

Right now this shading system has a small bug, which I will discuss in a later section of the documentation. Besides the minimum goal I created basic text file based level and field of view editors. I also created the option to make new characters that could block light, or player movement.

Features as of now:
* Real time 8 directional player movement
* Binary shading
* Map and field of view editors
* Character attribute editors (can this character block light? can it block player movement?)

The next main goal of the project is to make an animation pipeline. The plan for it is to have every frame drawn in a textfile under each other, with a general function that can read any animation text file into a 3 dimensional array, and another general function that could play said animation in a set position on the screen. Beside this main goal I plan to make several quality of life changes to the different text based editors and to the structure and efficency of the code in general.

# 2. How to use the engine
## 2.1. How the engine works: a breakdown of the main .cpp file
### 2.1.1. Initialization
#### 2.1.1.1. System variables
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
First things first. The system adds all variables, most of theese are vital for the engine and should not be altered (unless you understand how theese systems work, in that case go nuts!). All of theese will be explained in bigger detail in the next big segement of the documentation, but here are some examples:
```cpp
bool isWPressed;
```
This variable is true on any frame on which the W button is pressed.
```cpp
koordinate playerPov;
```
The koordinate structure has two sub variables: one for the x and another for the y axis. This koordinate variable stores the coordinate from which the player "sees" things. Algorythmically speaking it stores the coordinate from which lines are cast that will determine whether something is in the shadows or not.
```cpp
bool isNotExit = true;
```
While this variable is true the game loop keeps being called every x miliseconds.

#### 2.1.1.2. Alterable variables
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
The next category of variables are ones that are hardcoded, but can be freely altered to anyone's desire. Again I will provide some examples but every variable will be explained in detail in the next segment of the documentation:
```cpp
player.row = 31;
player.col = 45;
```
This is the starting position of the player. The row runs along the x axis and the col runs along the y axis. It should be noted that theese are different from the coordinates that are mentioned above. Theese refer to a set cell's row and column on the map. Each cell's four points have different coordinates. The cell that is defined by row = a and col = b has the following four coordinates associated with it's points: (a; b), (a + 1; b), (a; b + 1) and (a + 1; b + 1). It should also be noted that the coordinate system is only dealing with positive coordinates, and it's flipped, meaning that the (0; 0) point is in the top left, and the (infinity; infinity) point would be in the bottom right.
```cpp
int sleepTime = 30;
```
This variable is the number of miliseconds that pass between every iteration of the game loop.

#### 2.1.1.3. Variables that hold information parsed from the editors
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
The last variables that need initialization are all arrays. The values for theese variables are all stored in the text files that you can (and are meant to) edit. Theese variables will also be explored in a later section of the docmentaton. Some examples:
```cpp
fov right[FOVROWS][FOVCOLS];
```
This is a 2 dimensional array with information about the shape of the field of view when the player is facing the right side of the screen. Both FOVROWS and FOVCOLS are defined in the system.h header.
```cpp
map newWorld[WORLDROWS][WORLDCOLS];
```
This array contains information about the texture of the map, different parts that are blocking player movement and different parts that are blocking light thus producing shadows. Both WORLDROWS and WORLDCOLS are defined in the system.h header.

For more information about theese arrays please refer to [the part concerned with the editors](#22-how-to-use-the-editors-and-other-further-details).

### 2.1.2. The game loop
#### 2.1.2.1. Keeping the loop going, storing input and information from the last frame
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
After the initialization, the game loop is started. The first thing it does is to wait for the set amount of time before doing anything:
```cpp
Sleep(sleepTime);
```
Next it deals with incoming input. Setting back all the bools to false that store the input from the 5 different keys, then getting the button information from the keyboard for each and acting accordingly. The escape key is set up to be the one that exits out of the game, so if its pressed the gameloop terminates. If however the escape key is not pressed, we cancel out any input that would be contradictody, such as moving right and left at the same time:
```cpp
isWPressed = false;
isAPressed = false;
isSPressed = false;
isDPressed = false;
isEscPressed = false;

isWPressed = wPressed();
isAPressed = aPressed();
isSPressed = sPressed();
isDPressed = dPressed();
isEscPressed = escPressed();

if (isEscPressed)
{
	isNotExit = false;
}

cancelOut(isWPressed, isSPressed);
cancelOut(isAPressed, isDPressed);
```
With information from the last frame we can make the game run much faster and the graphics look much smoother, so we save the last position of our player character and the last frame of the screen (the screen of the console is segmented into two seperate arrays newScreen and newMenu, with their respective counterparts from the frame before being oldScreen and oldMenu):
```cpp
saveLastScreenArray(oldScreen, newScreen);
saveLastMenuArray(oldMenu, newMenu);
		
lastPlayer.row = player.row;
lastPlayer.col = player.col;
```
#### 2.1.2.2. Player and camera movement
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
With all of our existing input and information from the last frame, we can finally start to move the player! The first two functions are making sure the player moves according (if he can!) to the input. The final function sets up the direction in which the player is facing, this is also done with the input, if the D key is pressed the player will face right, if the W key is also pressed the player will face top AND right. Basically the player will face in whichever direction the inputs dictate in every frame:
```cpp
player = playerMovement(player, isWPressed, isSPressed, isAPressed, isDPressed);
player = keepInBounds(player, lastPlayer, newWorld);
player = setDirections(player, isWPressed, isSPressed, isAPressed, isDPressed);
```
We need the camera to follow our character, so our next we are dealing with this problem. The first function detects where the camera should be, next we pan the camera in that direction (it should be noted that panning the camera is not done instantly and needs time to be in the desired position), lastly we make sure that the camera is not going out of bounds:
```cpp
whereToCamera = camMovement(whereToCamera, player);
camera = cameraPan(camera, whereToCamera);
camera = keepCamInBounds(camera, newWorld);
```
#### 2.1.2.3. Producing the binary shading
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
Next we start preparing for the shading of the correct places. Firstly we apply the correct field of view. Then we find out where is the player situated in the selected field of view, this will act as an anchor point between the world and the FOV array. With the help of this anchor we add the FOV to the map, after this we will know which cells of the map are currently in the field of view of the player. The last thing we will need before we can start the shading is the point from which the player "sees", or from where we can cast lines to the correct places on the map:
```cpp
setCurrentFov(player, currentFov, right, left, up, down, rightUp, rightDown, leftUp, leftDown);
playerInFov = getPlayerPosInFov(player, playerInFov);
addFovInfoToMap(newWorld, player, playerInFov, currentFov);

playerPov = getPov(playerPov, player);
```
Theese three functions are the main focus of this engine. The first one is responsible for casting lines from the player's point of view to different walls in the enviroment, and calculating which cells are fully encapsualted in shadow. The second one makes everything a little bit prettier, it draws a line that is less shadow-y, inbetween the cells that are in the light and the ones that are in the dark. Whilst theese first two functions are concerned with calculating which cells are in view, or which are at the edge of light and darkness, the third function translates all this information into textures and hands it over to the newScreen array for rendering:
```cpp
shadowFunction(newWorld, camera.col, camera.row, playerPov, edges);
		
mapIsEdgeCalculation(newWorld, camera.row, camera.col);
	
calculateScreen(newWorld, newScreen, camera.row, camera.col);
```
#### 2.1.2.4. Rendering
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
Finally the last part of the game loop is repalcing the player character from the last frame with a ' ' and then re placing the player character into the correct position in the world. Then the newMenu is filled up with the line that divides it from the newScreen (more about theese arrays in [the part which is discussing the FOV editors](#221-the-fov-editors)). Lastly both the newScreen and newMenu are rendered in the console window:
```cpp
if (newScreen[lastPlayer.row - camera.row][lastPlayer.col - camera.col] == playerTexture)
{		
	newScreen[lastPlayer.row - camera.row][lastPlayer.col - camera.col] = ' ';
}
newScreen[player.row - camera.row][player.col - camera.col] = playerTexture;

for (int i = 0; i < SCREENROWS; i++)
{
	newMenu[i][0] = screenDivisionTexture;
}

renderScreen(oldScreen, newScreen);

renderMenu(oldMenu, newMenu);
```

And thus the cycle continues, if there is anything that needs clearing up the exact workings of the engine will be detailed in the third part of the documentation, and some details which I omited here will be covered in [the next half of the second part](#22-how-to-use-the-editors-and-other-further-details).

## 2.2. How to use the editors, and other further details
### 2.2.1. The FOV editors
#### 2.2.1.1. How to use the FOV editors
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
The FOV "editors" are the textfiles located in the FOVs folder. There is a file for each of the eight directions the player can look. For exaple, this is the rightUp.txt:
```
0000000000000000____________0000000  
00000000000_____________________000  
000000___________________________00  
0000______________________________0  
0__________________________________  
___________________________________  
___________________________________  
___________________________________  
0__________________________________

000_______________________________0  
0000_____________________________00  
00000___________________________000  
000000_________________________0000  
0000000@______________________00000  
00000000_____________________000000  
000000000___________________0000000  
0000000000_________________00000000  
00000000000_______________000000000  
0000000000000___________00000000000  
000000000000000_______0000000000000  
```
The description of each character:
* The '@' character represents the player, there should be exactly 1 of theese characters per FOV file because it acts as the anchor point between the .txt and the map on which the information about the field of view is pasted onto. (As of version 1.0.0. the position of this character does not get automatically parsed by the engine, so if you want to change it in this file you'll need to hardcode that change into the correct function as well. Fixing this issue is a planned goal for version 2.0.0.)
* The '_' characters represent cells that are in the player's field of view.
* The '0' characters represent cells that are not in the player's field of view.

You can freely redraw any part of theese .txt files, with the '@', '_' and '0' characters. The engine will parse the information and produce the new fields of view in the game. (When dealing with the '@' character please refer back to the description of it to make sure everything will work properly)

#### 2.2.1.2. The whys of the FOV editors and the explanation of the newScreen and newMenu arrays
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
All of theese .txt files have a set height (21) and width (35). I wanted to make FOVs that are symmetrical, because it doesn't make sense if for example the player has a bigger field of view when he is looking right than when he is looking up. Since the console window is 24 cells by 80 cells the maximum width of the field of view can only be roughly equal to the height of 24 cells. That comes to about 39 cells in width. I also wanted to make a margin around all of the field of views. The reasoning behind this decision was that I think it looks wierd if there is a cell that is in the field of view and also on the edge of the screen. Any such cell could mistakenly communicate that the field of view stretches beyond the screen which is (in my opinion) not something we want. As a result of all of this the field of view files shrunk to 21 by 35 (however upon further thinking for an easier time interpreting the editors I plan to expand their dimensions to 24 by 39 for the 2.0.0. version of the engine).

Since the dimansions of the field of view are this small there is plenty of space on the screen for other stuff to be displayed. Thus the console window was separated to the newScreen and newMenu arrays. As of now the newMenu array is not in use, I plan to add basic functions and/or editors that could produce a menu or an inventory system on that half of the console window. If you want to expand the dimensions of the FOV files you'll need to change the value of FOVROWS and FOVCOLS which are defined in the system.h header file, but be prepared, if you change it to anything that is bigger than the dimensions of the newScreen array (which is 24 by 39) you will run into complications.

### 2.2.2. How to use the material editors
###### This section was last checked in the 1.0.0. version of the engine
The material "editors" are the .txt files located in the materials folder. One of them (walkable.txt) contains characters that don't block player movement, and the other (solid.txt) contains characters that block light, thus creating shadows. Both of them function exactly the same, so I am only going to discuss the workings of the one concerned with the characters that are blocking light. Characters in the editor should be seperated by an enter. When you are updating this file, make sure that the value of SOLIDCOUNT equals that of the characters in this file, otherwise the function that loads theese characters would go over too few or too many of them.
